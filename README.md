It consists of 31 daily problems over the month of April.

## Overview
This is my Java Leetcode solution. As time grows, this also become a guide to prepare for software engineer interview.

I really take time to solve for the most efficient solution and collect the best resource that I found.
Because I wanted to help others like me, I added alternative (and in some cases more efficient) solutions to most of the problems.

The solution is at problems/the-file-name/. For example, LEFT BANK solution is at https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array/.
